# Thesis-Research-Archive

## Introduction
This is the research archive of my thesis: *Selection Bias Correction: Optimizing Estimation by Machine Learning Techniques and Doubly Robust Method in Pseudo-Weighting Approach*.

A project that compares several classification methods under Liu's Framework and its expanded version with doubly robust implementation. Here is the brief view of the structure of the Thesis-Research-Archive:

```

There are two datasets in this project: 

- Simulated data,
- the registered data of Dutch Online Kilometer Registration (DOKR data).

Note that *only* the simulated data is available publicly in this research archive.
And there are two simulation study in two separate folders:

 - Liu's_Framework,
 - Liu's_Framework&DoublyRobust.

In each folder of simulation study, there are three folders including:

 - **Data**: Contains the file of generating function for the simulated data and a information file for the DOKR data.
 - **scr**: Contains the source code of the simulation study.
 - **output**: Contains the outputs.
